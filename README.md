# HiveEngine

My custom Hive engine

Many thanks to Christian Melchior for his work on the Kotlin ASCII hex grid printer.
https://github.com/cmelchior/asciihexgrid
I stole his code and converted it into C# :^)

Long-term todo:

- Walking algorithm, could use in many bugs
- Not forgetting to incorporate cycles
- Not forgetting to incorporate when a bug can attack (after queen) etc.
